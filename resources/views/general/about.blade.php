            <p>Meagle is a site where you can find answers about any piece of subject, or write a answer about a piece
                of subject.</p>

            <p>Answers are voted on by other users and are then sorted by votes: the more votes a answer has, the higher
                it is.</p>

            <p>The more important a user is, the more their vote counts for: this makes it easy for top users to have
                their answers near the top.</p>

            <p><b>Meagle is open-source and is completely impartial.</b></p>
